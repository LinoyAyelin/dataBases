I created a database in ACCESS for people's details.
I implemented a form for managing the database:
- Clicking the "Update/Insert button will insert or update a record in the database.
- Clicking the "DELETE" button will display a warning message, and if the user confirms, the record matching the ID will be deleted.
- Clicking the "CLEAR" button will display a warning message, and if the user confirms, all records in the database will be deleted.
- Clicking "CLEAR DGV" will clear the content of the DataGridView control (without deleting the data from the database).
- Clicking "REFRESH DGV" will update the content of the DataGridView control (re-establishing the connection to the database).
- Selecting a row in the DataGridView will change the content of the textboxes accordingly.
- Clicking "View Selected Rows on New DGV" will open a new window containing a DataGridView control, where the content will be the rows selected from the main window.
- Clicking "View Selected Rows on New Form" will open a new window containing textboxes, where their content will be the selected row from the main window.

If you need additional details, feel free to ask!
